# Beyond Article App
The only place where you can see news from all over the world and beyond.<br>

## My first ever Vue project!
It was completed as a part of educational practice at the university. The idea was to create a news app with Vue 3 using Vue Router, Vuex and SCSS (which are new to me). I also had to implement fictional authorization and use localStorage to save information about user being logged in.
